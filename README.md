# LaravelPublishingPlatform-App

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a Laravel-powered publishing platform, where people can browse and filter 
(by tag or author) financial articles written by registered users in a powerful text editor. 
Authenticated users will be able to administer their publications using a dashboard 
(create/edit/delete), receive in-app notifications about newly published articles by other 
authors and emails for each article published by them. The live version of the app is 
hosted on Heroku:
